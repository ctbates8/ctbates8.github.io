  <strong>About Me</strong>
  </p><p>As a kid, I grew up dreaming to come to the University of Texas. I was able to cheer on Vince Young as he brought home a national championship, I was able to cheer on Justin Tucker as he kicked a game winning field goal in Kyle Field against Texas A&M, and now I am able to cheer on Sam Ehlinger as a current student at the University of Texas! I am currently a freshman business major and looking to pursure both a BBA degree along with an MPA degree through the iMPA program here at UT. Before coming to college, I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, and attended Stratford High School, the home of Andrew Luck. I grew a great passion for business early on as I figured out I hated every subject in school but math and loved asking my Dad what he did at work when he got home. When looking into where I wanted to go to college towards the end of my high school career, there was only one true choice as to where I wanted to go: The University of Texas. Not only was UT what I dreamed about my entire life, but UT is home to one of the top business schools in the world! That made my choice very easy as soon as I got in. That was the journey of the first 18 years of my life and that is the reason I gravitated to coming to the best university in the world.  <br />
