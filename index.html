  <strong>About Me</strong>
  </p><p>As A kid, I grew up dreaming to come to the University of Texas. I was able to cheer on Vince Young as he brought home a national championship, I was able to cheer on Justin Tucker as he kicked a game winning field goal in Kyle Field against Texas A&M, and now I am able to cheer on Sam Ehlinger as a current student at the University of Texas! I am currently a freshman business major and looking to pursure both a BBA degree along with an MPA degree through the iMPA program here at UT.  <br />
