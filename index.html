  <strong>About Me</strong>
  </p><p>As a kid, I grew up dreaming attending the University of Texas. I was able to celebrate Vince Young as he helped win a national championship, I was able to cheer on Justin Tucker as he kicked a game winning field goal in Kyle Field against Texas A&M, and now I am able to rally behind Sam Ehlinger as a current student at the University of Texas! Since the Fall of 2018, I have been enrolled as a business major here at UT and am looking to pursure both a BBA degree and an MPA degree through the acceptance into the iMPA program. My life before college consisted of being born and raised in Houston, Texas, and attended Stratford High School, the home of Andrew Luck. I grew a great passion for business early on as I figured out I hated every subject in school except math and loved waiting for my Dad to come home to ask him what he did at work. Near the end of high school as I was looking into where I wanted to attend college, there was really only one thought in my head as to where I wanted to go: The University of Texas. Not only was UT where I dreamed of going my entire life, but UT is home to one of the top business schools in the world! This statistic made my choice of where to go after I got accepted the easiest one of my life. Those are the many reasons I am where I am today and why I easily gravitated towards attending the best university in the world!  <br />
